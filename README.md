# Transit Over Time
A neat static website that showcases Toronto's subway infrastructure over the years!

### Development Instructions

This website is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) which it arguably shouldn't be, I am no good at the JavaScript but static websites are able to penetrate the walls of my incredibly thick skull.  That said, here's how to build this thing!

1. Download Jekyll (instructions available on their website linked above).
2. Clone the repo
3. Navigate to the repo in your terminal `cd .../transit-over-time`
4. `bundle exec jekyll serve`
5. Navigate to localhost:4000 in your browser and get going!

PRs welcome! <3
