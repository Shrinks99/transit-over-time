### About

In 1985 The Scarborough RT (Line 3) opened and was the first new dedicated rail line to open since 1966.  The fully automated rail line uses four car trains of considerably smaller cars running on a separate gauge of rail compared to the rest of the Toronto Subway.

Often criticized for its frequent shutdowns and inability to operate in adverse weather conditions the SRT is definitely not the most reliable or most favored transit solution in the city.  It is slated to close in the future most likely being replaced by a one stop subway extension of Line 2.
