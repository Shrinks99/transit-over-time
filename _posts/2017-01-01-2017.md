### About

2017 saw the opening of the Spadina extension and the renaming of Downsview station to Shepard West.  Line 1 was extended from the previous ending point at the former Downsview station up to Vaughan Metropolitan Centre, the first TTC station outside of the boundaries of Toronto.

The Eglinton LRT is still under construction during this period of time.
