### About

After discussion dating back to 1912 and five years of construction, Canada's first subway line opened on March 30, 1954.  The line (now a busy part of Line 1) extended from Toronto's Union Station up to the intersection of Yonge and Eglinton with bright red subway cars built by the Gloucester Railway Carriage and Wagon Company in England.
