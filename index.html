	<p>
		The TTC has changed quite a lot since 1954 although arguably it hasn't changed enough in recent years.  With the system ridership growing every year and politicians who are not transit planners in charge it doesn't exactly take a lot of thinking to realize why the system isn't perhaps working as fast or as efficiently as it should be.

		Nonetheless, it is interesting to see how far the city actually <em>has</em> come and hopefully this website will serve as a nice little historical trip into the past so maybe we can be thankful we at least have the current system before we complain about how crowded it is.
