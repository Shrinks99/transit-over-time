	<p>
		The Toronto Subway has changed quite a lot since 1954 although arguably it hasn't changed enough in recent years.  With the system ridership growing every year and politicians who are not transit planners in charge the system isn't working as fast or as efficiently as it probably should be.

		Nonetheless, it is interesting to see how far the city actually <em>has</em> come and hopefully this website will serve as a nice little historical trip into the past so maybe we can be thankful that have the current system before we complain about how crowded it is.  That said, I am of the opinion that — based on Toronto's population and the inaction and inibility of the municipal government to build substantial infrastructure improvents from 2002-2019 — planning for the TTC should be left to an external committee of professional city planners and not to council... But that's just my take on the matter.
